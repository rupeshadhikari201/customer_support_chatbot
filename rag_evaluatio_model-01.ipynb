Keep in mind that the number of revision rounds should align with what was agreed upon in the initial contract.\\n\\n3. If the revisions don\\'t meet your expectations or if the issues are severe, you can dispute the project. GOKAP InnoTech has a dispute resolution process in place to help clients and freelancers resolve disagreements. To initiate a dispute, follow these steps:\\n\\n   a. Navigate to the relevant project in your \"My Projects\" dashboard.\\n   b. Click on the \"Dispute\" button.\\n   c. Provide a detailed explanation of the issues and the outcome you\\'re seeking. Be sure to include any relevant evidence or communication history.\\n\\n4. GOKAP InnoTech\\'s support team will review the dispute and may mediate between you and the freelancer to reach a resolution. If necessary, they may issue a refund or help facilitate alternative solutions.\\n\\n5. In cases where the freelancer\\'s work is not up to the agreed standards and revisions or mediation are not successful, it may be necessary to find a different freelancer to complete the project. In this case, you can use the GOKAP InnoTech platform to find and hire a new freelancer, or you can contact the support team for assistance.', multi_responses=None, reference=\"If you're not satisfied with the freelancer's work on GOKAP InnoTech, the platform recommends starting with direct communication through the project messaging system. If the issue persists, you can request revisions by selecting 'Request Revisions' under the project details. For unresolved disputes, you can open a formal dispute via 'Project Actions' and submit supporting evidence. GOKAP’s mediation team will review the case within 48 hours. The platform also offers options for partial payments or full refunds, depending on the situation and project type.\", rubrics=None)"
